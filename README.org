* Motivation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: motivation
:END:
I wanted to port my existing blog to Nextjs and Tailwind CSS but there
was no easy out of the box template to use so I decided to create one.
Design is adapted from
[[https://github.com/tailwindlabs/blog.tailwindcss.com][Tailwindlabs
blog]].

I wanted it to be nearly as feature-rich as popular blogging templates
like [[https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll][beautiful-jekyll]]
and [[https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules][Hugo Academic]]
but with the best of React's ecosystem and current web development's
best practices.

npx degit 'timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog'
#+end_src

2. [@2] Personalize =siteMetadata.js= (site related information)
3. Modify the content security policy in =next.config.js= if you want to
   use other analytics provider or a commenting solution other than
   giscus.
4. Personalize =authors/default.md= (main author)
5. Modify =projectsData.ts=
6. Modify =headerNavLinks.ts= to customize navigation links
7. Add blog posts
8. Deploy on Vercel

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:
#+begin_src sh
yarn
#+end_src

* Development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: development
:END:
First, run the development server:

#+begin_src sh
yarn dev
#+end_src

Open [[http://localhost:3000]] with your browser to see the result.

Edit the layout in =app= or content in =data=. With live reloading, the
pages auto-updates as you edit them.

* Extend / Customize
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: extend-customize
:END:

=data/siteMetadata.js= - contains most of the site related information
which should be modified for a user's need.

=data/authors/default.md= - default author information (required).
Additional authors can be added as files in =data/authors=.

=data/projectsData.js= - data used to generate styled card on the
projects page.

=data/headerNavLinks.js= - navigation links.

=data/logo.svg= - replace with your own logo.

=data/blog= - replace with your own blog posts.

=public/static= - store assets such as images and favicons.

=tailwind.config.js= and =css/tailwind.css= - tailwind configuration and
stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of
the site.

=css/prism.css= - controls the styles associated with the code blocks.
Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme
e.g. [[https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes][prism themes]].

=contentlayer.config.ts= - configuration for Contentlayer, including
definition of content sources and MDX plugins used. See
[[https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started][Contentlayer
documentation]] for more information.

=components/MDXComponents.js= - pass your own JSX code or React
component by specifying it over here. You can then use them directly in
the =.mdx= or =.md= file. By default, a custom link, =next/image=
component, table of contents component and Newsletter form are passed
down. Note that the components should be default exported to avoid
[[https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51593][existing issues with
Next.js]].

=layouts= - main templates used in pages:

- There are currently 3 post layouts available: =PostLayout=,
  =PostSimple= and =PostBanner=. =PostLayout= is the default 2 column
  layout with meta and author information. =PostSimple= is a simplified
  version of =PostLayout=, while =PostBanner= features a banner image.
- There are 2 blog listing layouts: =ListLayout=, the layout used in
  version 1 of the template with a search bar and =ListLayoutWithTags=,
  currently used in version 2, which omits the search bar but includes a
  sidebar with information on the tags.

=app= - pages to route to. Read the
[[https://nextjs.org/docs/app][Next.js documentation]] for more
information.

=next.config.js= - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt
the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc.
from other domains.

* Post
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: post
:END:
Content is modelled using [[https://www.contentlayer.dev/][Contentlayer]], which allows you to define your own
content schema and use it to generate typed content objects. See [[https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started][Contentlayer
documentation]] for more information.

* Deploy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deploy
:END:
*Vercel*\\
The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [[https://vercel.com][Vercel]]. Check out the
[[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying][Next.js deployment documentation]] for more details.

*Netlify* [[https://www.netlify.com/][Netlify]]'s Next.js runtime
configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the
need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless
functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side
rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR),
=next/images=, etc.

See [[https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime][Next.js on Netlify]] for suggested configuration values and more details.

*Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.*

1. Add =output: 'export'= in =next.config.js=. See
   [[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration][static
   exports documentation]] for more information.

2. Comment out =headers()= from =next.config.js=.

3. Add =unoptimized: true= to the =images= key in =next.config.js=:

   Alternatively, to continue using =next/image=, you can use an
   alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or
   Akamai. See
   [[https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization][image
   optimization documentation]] for more details.

4. Remove =api= folder and components which call the server-side
   function such as the Newsletter component. Not technically required
   and the site will build successfully, but the APIs cannot be used as
   they are server-side functions.

5. Run =yarn build=. The generated static content is in the =out=
   folder.

6. Deploy the =out= folder to your hosting service of choice or run
   =npx serve out= to view the website locally.

*Note*: Deploying on Github pages require addition modifications to the
base path. Please refer to the FAQ for more information.
